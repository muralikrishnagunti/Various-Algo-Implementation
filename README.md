Implementations of various algorithms in C++, using Object Oriented Programming. The algorithms implemented in the codes attached above include finding Strongly Connected Components in a directed graph (using Kosaraju's Algorithm), finding the Topological Sorting of a given directed graph, detect a cycle in a graph (using DFS), finding maximum sum of weights in a path of weighted DAG (using DP), generating Fibonacci Numbers by using Matrix Multiplication (divide and conquer approach), find the primes within a range by using Segmented Sieve.
